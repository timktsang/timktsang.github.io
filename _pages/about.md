Dr Tim Tsang obtained his BSc (Mathematics) and MPhil (Mathematics) from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and PhD (Public Health) from The University of Hong Kong. After graduation, he spent three years as a postdoctoral associate in biostatistics at University of Florida.

His research interest is to develop mathematical and statistical methods for infectious disease dynamics and epidemiology. He develops statistical methods to analyze different types of infectious disease data for acute infectious disease such as COVID-19, human and avian influenza, dengue, norovirus and zika. He develops statistical models to perform estimations and simulations for assessment of control measure and public health interventions. Also, he is interested in integrating infectious disease data from different sources to obtain comprehensive insights for infections and transmissions. 

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
