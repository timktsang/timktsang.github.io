I am an Assistant Professor at HKU School of Public Health. My research interest is to develop mathematical and statistical methods for infectious disease dynamics and epidemiology. I develop statistical methods to analyze different types of infectious disease data for acute infectious disease such as COVID-19, human and avian influenza, dengue, norovirus and zika. I develop statistical models to perform estimations and simulations for assessment of control measure and public health interventions. Also, I am interested in integrating infectious disease data from different sources to obtain comprehensive insights for infections and transmissions.
